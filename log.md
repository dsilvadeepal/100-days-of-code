# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 18, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Completed first interaction with github by forking the orignal 100-days-of-code repository in order to begin day one tomorrow. Deleted old FreeCodeCamp profile and started new one to complete the challenges in a tighter timeframe in order to properly complete each certificates projects.

**Thoughts:** Excited to start FreeCodeCamp again with more confidence. Pumped to set up git as well to start adding projects from FCC and AIT 618 to github

### Day 1: August 19, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML5 and CSS section of FCC in one sitting.

**Thoughts:** Already knew HTML5 and CSS section when completing but it served as a great refresher.

### Day 2: August 20, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Completed bootstrap section of FCC.

**Thoughts:** Glad i'm restarting FCC as I didnot remember how to use bootstrap. Hoping to complete jQuery section today as well so beginners projects can be started tomorrow.
