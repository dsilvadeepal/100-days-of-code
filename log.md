# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 18, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Completed first interaction with github by forking the orignal 100-days-of-code repository in order to begin day one tomorrow. Deleted old FreeCodeCamp profile and started new one to complete the challenges in a tighter timeframe in order to properly complete each certificates projects.

**Thoughts:** Excited to start FreeCodeCamp again with more confidence. Pumped to set up git as well to start adding projects from FCC and AIT 618 to github

### Day 1: August 19, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML5 and CSS section of FCC in one sitting.

**Thoughts:** Already knew HTML5 and CSS section when completing but it served as a great refresher.

### Day 2: August 20, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Completed bootstrap section of FCC. Also completed jQuery section. Chose Ryan Holiday as tribute page topic and began sketching a rough diagram of the project that I will code tomorrow, day 3.

**Thoughts:** Glad i'm restarting FCC as I didnot remember how to use bootstrap. ~~Hoping to complete jQuery section today as well so beginners projects can be started tomorrow.~~ finished jQuery and remembered most of it. Decided on building my Tribute page tomorrow on Ryan Holiday, author of many books I enjoy including 'The Obstacle is the Way'. I believe I've decided on building the first two beginner projects in codepen so I can get them under my belt, then I will do all remaning projects using github and githubpages.
