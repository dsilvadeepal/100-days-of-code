# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 18, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Completed first interaction with github by forking the orignal 100-days-of-code repository in order to begin day one tomorrow. Deleted old FreeCodeCamp profile and started new one to complete the challenges in a tighter timeframe in order to properly complete each certificates projects.

**Thoughts:** Excited to start FreeCodeCamp again with more confidence. Pumped to set up git as well to start adding projects from FCC and AIT 618 to github

### Day 1: August 19, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML5 and CSS section of FCC in one sitting.

**Thoughts:** Already knew HTML5 and CSS section when completing but it served as a great refresher.

### Day 2: August 20, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Completed bootstrap section of FCC. Also completed jQuery section. Chose Ryan Holiday as tribute page topic and began sketching a rough diagram of the project that I will code tomorrow, day 3.

**Thoughts:** Glad i'm restarting FCC as I didnot remember how to use bootstrap. ~~Hoping to complete jQuery section today as well so beginners projects can be started tomorrow.~~ finished jQuery and remembered most of it. Decided on building my Tribute page tomorrow on Ryan Holiday, author of many books I enjoy including 'The Obstacle is the Way'. I believe I've decided on building the first two beginner projects in codepen so I can get them under my belt, then I will do all remaning projects using github and githubpages.

### Day 3: August 21, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Started tribute page project on codepen. Created all markup and added necessary images. Begun organizing html markup into necessary div containers etc. Reading through bootstrap documentation.

**Thoughts:** Figuring out how to use bootstrap and the proper class titles to style page properly wasn't difficult but time consuming. Need a better plan before starting to code next time. Will finish div's, add the rest of the proper bootstrap classes and style page in css tomorrow so I can progress to porfolio challenge either tommorrow night or Tuesday.

### Day 4: August 22, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Sharpened up the bootstrap and completed the CSS for the Ryan Holiday Tribute page for FCC. Submitted to FCC. Begun planning porfolio page that I will begin coding tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Had fun building the Tribute page though it reminded me how much I have to learn about web design. The proper spacing, color scheme etc. is still out of my grasp but this project was great practice. I will be adding more detail and taking a deeper dive into this with the next project, the porfolio page. It will be fun to look back and see my progress in a few months when I have more web pages/sites under my belt. I do need to learn more on bootsrap, particularly how to properly use their grid system for each type of screeen rather than limiting myself to just the xs or md sizes.

### Day 5: August 23, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Added markup of all text to my FCC portfolio page in FCC. Figuring out the exact layout of each page before begining to code tomorrow. Grabbed necessary images from the web.

**Thoughts:** Want to make this a very good looking portfolio despite it being my first build through, definitely want it to look better and take a longer stab at it than with my tribute page and past personal projects. Will be using HTML, CSS, jQuery and Bootsrap to complete this project. Currently deciding how best to layout the page. I want to include boxes for each 10 projects associated with each of the 3 certificates, Frontend, Backend and Data Visualization. I also want to include course descriptions in a towson section on the portfolio page. Possibly linking some school projects to it in the distant future. Will also be including a nav bar and bio section. I know how to complete the user stories but I want this page to look better than the FCC example project and be well organized/viewable with all the info I want to present.

### Day 6: August 24, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: No code today. Only reading about bootstrap for portfolio and looking into how to make a logo. Will add extra day to make 101 days of code as no progress was made today.

**Missed two weeks of this challenge. Will be restarting from day one, picking up with my last project, the FCC Portfolio Page.**

### Day 1: September 9, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Added links to navbar. decided to keep seperate pages for each FCC cert projects rather than a menu that would squish them. nav bar will still have to be manipulated with css etc. but got it positioned and finalized all necessary links tonight.

**Thoughts:** Glad to be working on this again. I think I overwhelmed myself with a portfolio idea that was not beyond my capabilities but very labor intensive. I am now just focused on getting each page laid out daily and then I will work out how to animate and design the page once everything is in working order.
