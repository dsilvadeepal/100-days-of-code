# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 18, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Completed first interaction with github by forking the orignal 100-days-of-code repository in order to begin day one tomorrow. Deleted old FreeCodeCamp profile and started new one to complete the challenges in a tighter timeframe in order to properly complete each certificates projects.

**Thoughts:** Excited to start FreeCodeCamp again with more confidence. Pumped to set up git as well to start adding projects from FCC and AIT 618 to github
